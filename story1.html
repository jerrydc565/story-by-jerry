            Why The Tortoise Has a Cracked Shell

          <span id="Long"> L </span>ong ago, in a time when all the animals
          lived together in harmony, there was a great drought in the land. The
          animals were hungry, and food was scarce. One day, the birds decided
          to help by flying up to the sky, where they knew of a grand feast
          being held by their friends, the sky-dwellers. The clever Tortoise,
          hearing of this plan, begged the birds to let him join them. "But
          Tortoise," they said, "you have no wings!" The resourceful Tortoise
          suggested that each bird give him one feather, and together they could
          make him a pair of wings. The kind-hearted birds agreed. Before they
          left, Tortoise suggested that they each take new names for the feast,
          as was the custom in those days. He chose for himself the name "All of
          You." When they arrived at the feast, their hosts announced that the
          food was prepared "for all of you." Tortoise, being clever but greedy,
          claimed that since his name was "All of You," all the food belonged to
          him! He ate and ate while the birds watched hungrily. Angry at his
          trickery, when it was time to return home, the birds took back their
          feathers. Tortoise, stranded in the sky, begged them to at least tell
          his wife to put soft things outside his house so he could land safely.
          The birds, still bitter about his deception, told his wife to put out
          hard objects instead. When Tortoise fell from the sky, his once-smooth
          shell crashed against the hard ground, breaking into many pieces.
          Spider, who lived nearby, helped piece him back together, but could
          never make the shell smooth again. And that is why, to this day, the
          tortoise's shell has many crack-like patterns.
