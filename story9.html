          <span id="Long"> I </span>n the days when yams could speak, there
          lived a poor farmer named Obiora who owned just a small plot of land.
          Unlike his neighbors who had vast farms, Obiora treated each of his
          yams with special care, talking to them every day as he worked his
          field. One morning, while digging up his harvest, he was startled to
          hear a yam talk back! This yam was larger than the others and had
          unusual golden-brown skin that seemed to shimmer in the sunlight.
          "Obiora," the yam spoke, "because you have shown kindness to all your
          crops, I will grant you a wish. But remember - a greedy wish brings
          grief, while a wise wish brings joy." Obiora thought carefully. His
          first instinct was to wish for a bigger farm or more yams. But as he
          looked at his small but healthy field, he remembered how his
          grandfather always said, "The sweetest yam is the one you've nurtured
          yourself." So instead, he wished for the knowledge to help other
          farmers grow better crops. The magic yam glowed brightly and dissolved
          into a shower of golden dust that spread across the land. From that
          day forward, Obiora discovered he could understand the whispers of all
          plants. He learned when they were thirsty, when they needed more sun,
          and when they were ready for harvest. He shared this knowledge freely
          with other farmers, teaching them to listen to their crops and care
          for them properly. Soon, the entire village's harvest improved. People
          came from far and wide to learn from Obiora. Though his farm remained
          small, his wisdom helped feed countless families, and he became known
          as the happiest farmer in all the land.
