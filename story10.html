          <span id="Long"> I </span>n ancient times, before electricity lit up
          our nights, the Moon had a special promise to the children of Earth.
          Each month, she would come down from the sky, disguised as an old
          woman, to check if children were keeping their traditions and
          respecting their elders. One such night, in a small village, only a
          young girl named Olayinka was awake, unable to sleep because of
          hunger. Her family had fallen on hard times after a poor harvest. As
          she sat outside her hut, she saw an old woman struggling with a heavy
          bag. Despite her own hunger and fatigue, Olayinka rushed to help the
          old woman. She offered her a seat, brought her water from the stream,
          and even shared her last piece of dried cassava. As they talked,
          Olayinka told stories she had learned from her grandmother, sang
          traditional songs, and showed the old woman how she was learning to
          weave raffia like her mother had taught her. The old woman smiled,
          revealing teeth that glowed like starlight. "I am the Moon," she said,
          "and you have shown me that the old ways still live in the hearts of
          children." She reached into her bag and pulled out a handful of
          shining beads. "Plant these in your family's farm when the night is
          darkest," she instructed. "But remember - you must sing the old songs
          while planting them." Olayinka did as she was told, singing the
          traditional farming songs her grandmother had taught her. By the next
          full moon, the beads had grown into plants bearing fruits and
          vegetables of silver and gold. But more precious than the magical
          crops was the lesson that spread through the village: keeping
          traditions alive brings its own kind of magic. From that day forward,
          during every full moon, parents would tell their children to look up
          at the Moon's bright face and remember her promise - that she watches
          over those who remember their roots and help others, even in times of
          need.

        Moral: Our traditions and kindness are like seeds that, when nurtured,
        can grow into unexpected blessings.
