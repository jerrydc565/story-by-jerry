          <span id="Long"> I </span>n a small village near the Niger River lived
          a young girl named Adanna who lost both her parents at a very young
          age. She lived with her stepmother and stepsister, who treated her
          poorly, making her do all the hard work while they relaxed in the
          shade. One day, while fetching water from the river, Adanna met an old
          woman who was struggling to cross. Despite her own fatigue, Adanna
          helped the woman across and shared her last piece of yam with her. The
          old woman, who was a spirit in disguise, was touched by Adanna's
          kindness. "My child," she said, "take this palm kernel and plant it
          behind your compound. But remember - you must water it with your tears
          and speak to it with love." Adanna did as she was told. Each morning
          and evening, while doing her chores, she would cry near the palm
          kernel and share her sorrows with it. Soon, a beautiful palm tree
          grew, but this was no ordinary tree. Whenever Adanna sang to it, the
          tree would drop delicious palm fruits and beautiful gifts - fine
          clothes, jewelry, and even food. Her stepmother and stepsister,
          noticing Adanna's sudden good fortune, spied on her and discovered the
          secret. The stepsister tried to copy Adanna, but when she sang to the
          tree, instead of gifts, she was showered with dirt and thorns. Angry,
          the stepmother ordered the tree to be cut down. But that night, the
          spirit appeared again to Adanna and told her to take a single leaf
          from the fallen tree. This leaf turned into an even more magnificent
          palm tree that would only respond to Adanna's voice. From that day
          forward, Adanna prospered and eventually became a wealthy and
          respected woman in her village. She never forgot her humble beginnings
          and always helped others in need.
