             n a time when the night sky was completely
          dark, there lived a young girl named Chioma who was known throughout
          her village for her exceptional weaving skills. Her fingers could
          create the most intricate patterns anyone had ever seen, and her cloth
          shimmered like morning dew. Chioma had learned weaving from her
          grandmother, who before passing away, gave her a special set of golden
          threads and whispered, "These threads are woven from light itself. Use
          them wisely, for they can bring light to the darkest places." In those
          days, people feared the night because it was pitch black. They would
          huddle in their homes as soon as the sun set, afraid of the creatures
          that lurked in the darkness. Chioma often heard the children crying,
          scared of the absolute darkness that surrounded them. One night,
          unable to sleep and thinking of her grandmother's words, Chioma took
          out the golden threads and her weaving tools. She climbed to the top
          of the highest hill and began to weave. As her fingers worked the
          threads, each knot she tied floated up into the sky and began to
          twinkle. She wove all night long, creating patterns just like the ones
          her grandmother had taught her. When dawn came, everyone in the
          village was amazed to see tiny points of light dotting the night sky.
          The children were no longer afraid of the dark, for Chioma's woven
          lights - which we now call stars - provided just enough light to
          comfort them. The elders say that even today, if you look carefully at
          the star patterns, you can see the same designs that were in Chioma's
          woven cloths. And on some nights, when new stars appear, they say it's
          Chioma, still weaving light into the darkness.

        Moral: A gift shared with others can transform fear into beauty, and one
        person's creativity can bring light to many.
