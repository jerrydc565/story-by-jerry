          <span id="Long"> L </span>ong ago, the Hawk and the Hen were best
          friends who lived together in the same compound. They would share
          meals, watch each other's children, and help each other with daily
          tasks. The Hawk was known for her excellent cooking, while the Hen was
          praised for her skillful farming. One day, the Hawk had to travel to a
          distant village for her sister's wedding. She asked her friend Hen to
          look after her three eggs until she returned. "Of course!" said Hen,
          "Your eggs will be as safe as my own chicks." The Hawk thanked her
          friend and flew away. That evening, as Hen was preparing dinner, she
          accidentally knocked over a pot of hot soup. The soup spilled onto the
          nest where she had placed Hawk's eggs, cooking them instantly. Hen was
          devastated but too afraid to tell Hawk the truth. When Hawk returned a
          week later and asked about her eggs, Hen lied, saying they had been
          stolen by the Monitor Lizard. But as Hawk looked around, she noticed
          eggshell pieces in Hen's cooking area and realized what had happened.
          She wasn't angry about the accident, but the lie broke her heart.
          "From this day forward," declared Hawk, "our friendship is over. And
          because you couldn't tell me the truth about my children, I will
          forever hunt yours." She flew away in sorrow. This is why, to this
          day, when a hawk appears in the sky, mother hens quickly gather their
          chicks under their wings and remember the cost of a broken trust
          between friends.
