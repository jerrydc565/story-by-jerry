          <span id="Long"> I </span>n a village that straddled a great river
          lived two brothers, Nduka the elder and Chidi the younger. When their
          father, the village sage, grew old, he called them to his bedside and
          showed them a mysterious clay pot. "Inside this pot," he whispered,
          "lies all the wisdom I have gathered in my lifetime. One of you will
          inherit it, but first, you must prove yourselves worthy. Take the pot
          to the top of the Wisdom Hill beyond the river, without opening it.
          The one who succeeds will not only gain the pot but become the next
          village sage." The next morning, Nduka, being the eldest, took the
          first attempt. He strapped the pot to his back and began his journey.
          But curiosity overwhelmed him halfway up the hill. "Surely," he
          thought, "I could peek inside and use some of the wisdom to help me
          climb better." The moment he opened the pot, all the wisdom escaped in
          a great gust of wind, scattering like leaves across the valley.
          Ashamed, Nduka returned home. Now it was Chidi's turn. But instead of
          trying to climb the hill, he sat by the river for three days, watching
          how the birds built their nests and how the ants carried heavy loads
          together. On the fourth day, he began his journey, but not before
          asking the village children to join him, singing and telling stories
          as they climbed. When they reached the top, Chidi discovered that the
          pot was empty. His father, who had followed them secretly, emerged
          smiling. "The true wisdom," he said, "was not in the pot at all, but
          in learning how to climb the hill. Nduka sought wisdom for himself
          alone, but you, Chidi, knew that wisdom grows when shared with
          others." From that day forward, Chidi became known as a wise leader
          who never kept knowledge to himself but shared it freely with all who
          wished to learn.

        Moral: True wisdom lies not in what we keep to ourselves, but in what we
        learn and share with others.
