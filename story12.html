          <span id="Long"> I </span>n the heart of an ancient forest stood a
          massive iroko tree unlike any other. Its branches stretched so high
          they seemed to touch the clouds, and its trunk was wider than ten men
          standing hand in hand. But what made this tree truly special was its
          unique power - anyone who told a lie while standing beneath its
          branches would immediately turn purple until they spoke the truth. The
          tree became known as the Justice Tree, and the village chief would
          hold all important meetings beneath its branches. One year, during a
          terrible drought, food began disappearing from the village storehouse.
          The chief gathered everyone under the Justice Tree to find the
          culprit. Among those gathered was Obioma, the chief's favorite
          advisor, who always wore elaborate robes and claimed to have magic
          powers. When questioned about the missing food, Obioma confidently
          declared, "I know nothing about the missing food. In fact, I've been
          fasting for the past month to bring rain to our land!" Instantly,
          Obioma turned a deep shade of purple. The crowd gasped as his
          elaborate robes suddenly seemed less magnificent. Under the tree's
          power, the truth came tumbling out - he had been stealing food and
          selling it to a neighboring village. But then something unexpected
          happened. As Obioma confessed and showed genuine remorse, the tree's
          leaves began to rustle and drop small golden fruits. These fruits,
          when planted, grew into crops that could survive the drought. The tree
          had turned Obioma's dishonesty into a blessing for the entire village.
          The chief, showing wisdom, declared that Obioma would repay his debt
          by teaching others how to grow these new crops. From that day forward,
          people said that the greatest power of the Justice Tree was not in
          revealing lies, but in turning wrongs into opportunities for
          redemption.
