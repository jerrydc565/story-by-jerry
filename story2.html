          <span id="Long"> L </span>ong ago, the sky was so close to the Earth
          that people could reach up and break off pieces to eat. Yes, the sky
          was made of sweet, delicious food that never ran out! The people of
          Earth lived in abundance, taking pieces of sky whenever they were
          hungry. Chief Sky, who ruled the heavens, had only one rule: "Take
          only what you need for the day, and waste nothing." For many years,
          the people followed this rule, and there was harmony between Sky and
          Earth. But as time passed, people became wasteful. They would take
          huge chunks of sky, have feasts, and throw away what they couldn't
          eat. They would play games with pieces of sky, tossing them around
          like balls. Some even fed sky pieces to their animals! One day, a
          group of children was playing with sky food, throwing it at each other
          and letting it rot on the ground. An old wise woman saw this and
          warned, "If you continue to waste the sky's gifts, it will go away
          forever." But no one listened to her. That evening, during a
          particularly wasteful feast, Chief Sky became very angry. His voice
          boomed across the land: "I gave you this gift of food, but you have
          shown no respect. You waste my blessing and teach your children to do
          the same. Now you must learn what it means to work for your food." And
          with that, the sky began to move upward, higher and higher, until it
          reached where it is today. From that day forward, people had to learn
          to plant crops, tend to farms, and work hard for their food. But the
          old people say that on quiet nights, you can still smell the sweet
          aroma of sky food, reminding us of a time when the sky was close
          enough to touch.

        Moral: We must respect and appreciate our blessings, for what is freely
        given can also be taken away if we prove unworthy of the gift.
