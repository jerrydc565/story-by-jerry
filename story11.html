          <span id="Long"> I </span>n a village near a great bend in the Niger
          River lived a young girl named Adanna, who was known for playing the
          most beautiful music on her father's talking drum. The drum had been
          passed down through generations, made from wood of a sacred tree.
          Unlike other children who played at the riverside, Adanna would sit
          alone, playing her drum and watching the river flow. The villagers
          often warned children not to get too close to the river, for it was
          said to be home to mysterious water spirits. One day, while playing a
          particularly moving rhythm, Adanna noticed something extraordinary -
          the river began to dance! The water swirled and swayed to her beat,
          forming patterns and shapes she'd never seen before. Then, from the
          swirling waters emerged a water spirit in the form of a beautiful
          woman with hair like flowing water. "Your music speaks to the heart of
          the river," the spirit said. "For centuries, we have waited for
          someone who could play the sacred rhythms that would awaken the
          river's voice." The spirit taught Adanna ancient river songs that
          could call the rain in times of drought, calm storms during the rainy
          season, and even help fishermen find the best spots to cast their
          nets. However, she warned Adanna that these songs must only be played
          when needed, not for entertainment. Adanna used her gift wisely,
          helping her village prosper while keeping the river's secrets. She
          eventually became the village's first female chief drummer, teaching
          selected students the sacred rhythms, but only to those who showed
          both skill and wisdom. To this day, they say that if you listen
          carefully by the river at sunset, you can sometimes hear the echoes of
          Adanna's drum, still dancing with the water spirits.
