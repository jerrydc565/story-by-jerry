          <span id="Long"> I </span>n a small village where weaving was considered the most noble of arts lived a girl named Amaka. Unlike other weavers who created beautiful but ordinary patterns, Amaka could weave stories into her cloth - patterns that seemed to move and dance in the sunlight. But she had a secret: she could only weave when she heard the morning birds sing.
          Each dawn, while the village slept, Amaka would sit at her loom near her window, listening to the birds' songs. As each bird sang its unique melody, different patterns would flow from her fingers into the cloth. The dove's coo created gentle waves, the eagle's cry wove bold zigzags, and the tiny sunbird's chirp added spots of bright color.
          One year, a mysterious silence fell over the village. The birds had disappeared, and no one knew why. Without their songs, Amaka couldn't weave. The village's annual festival was approaching - a time when weavers presented their finest works to honor the ancestors. Amaka grew desperate.
          Late one night, she followed a faint chirping sound into the forest. Deep in the woods, she discovered that a giant spider had woven a massive web, trapping all the birds. The spider, impressed by Amaka's own weaving fame, offered her a deal: if she could weave a pattern he had never seen before, he would free the birds.
          Amaka agreed but wondered how she could weave without the birds' songs. As she sat at her loom in the forest, she closed her eyes and remembered every morning song she had ever heard. To her amazement, the memories themselves guided her hands, creating a pattern that showed the story of the birds' capture and her journey to free them.
          The spider, who had never seen a cloth that told a story, was so amazed that he not only freed the birds but taught Amaka how to weave with spider silk, making her patterns shimmer like morning dew.

        Moral: The songs we carry in our hearts can guide us even when the world falls silent, and true creativity comes from within.
