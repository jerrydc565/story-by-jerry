          <span id="Long"> L </span>ong ago, before animals lost their power of
          speech, there lived a clever goat named Mbu who was known throughout
          the land for his exceptional bargaining skills. Unlike other animals
          who simply ate whatever they found, Mbu believed in trading to get the
          best of everything. One sunny morning, Mbu started his day with a
          single cola nut. He walked to the market, where he met a hungry
          monkey. "This cola nut," Mbu said, "is the sweetest in all the land.
          I'll trade it for two ripe bananas." The monkey, craving the cola nut,
          agreed. Mbu then found a parrot who loved bananas. "These bananas," he
          declared, "are from the tallest tree in the forest. I'll trade them
          for three fresh palm fruits." The parrot, impressed by the bananas'
          yellow perfection, agreed. Throughout the day, Mbu continued trading:
          the palm fruits for some honey, the honey for some corn, the corn for
          a small yam, and so on. With each trade, he gained a little more. By
          sunset, he had traded his way up to a whole basket of various foods
          and a new walking stick. Pleased with his success, Mbu headed home. On
          his way, he came across an old tortoise who had fallen and couldn't
          get up. Without hesitation, Mbu set down his trading gains and helped
          the tortoise back to his feet. The tortoise, who was a wise spirit in
          disguise, was moved by Mbu's kindness. "You've spent all day trading
          up for greater wealth," the tortoise observed, "but gave it up freely
          to help another. That is the best trade of all." With those words, the
          tortoise touched Mbu's head, blessing him with eternal wisdom. From
          that day forward, Mbu became known not just for his bargaining skills,
          but for teaching others that the greatest profit comes from helping
          those in need.
