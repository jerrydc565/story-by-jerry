          n a village famous for its music lived a young boy named Olayinka,
          who was born unable to speak. Though he couldn't talk, Olayinka had a
          special gift - his hands could create the most beautiful rhythms on
          any drum he touched. His father, the village's master drummer, had
          given him a special drum made from an ancient tree. Every evening,
          Olayinka would sit at the village square, playing his drum. The music
          was so enchanting that even the birds would stop to listen. But there
          was one thing peculiar about his drum - whenever danger was
          approaching the village, the drum would start playing on its own,
          warning everyone. One year, during the harvest festival, a group of
          bandits planned to raid the village. They chose this time because they
          knew everyone would be celebrating and off guard. As night fell and
          the village slept, Olayinka's drum began to play by itself - a
          frantic, urgent rhythm that woke the entire village. At first, people
          were angry at being awakened, but the village chief recognized the
          warning in the rhythm. He quickly organized the warriors, and they
          caught the bandits by surprise. The village was saved! But something
          even more magical happened that night. As Olayinka played a victory
          song on his drum, his voice suddenly returned! The village medicine
          man explained that the ancient tree from which the drum was made had
          been waiting for someone pure of heart to break its spell. From that
          day forward, Olayinka could both speak and play his drum. But he never
          forgot the lesson he learned - that there are many ways to
          communicate, and sometimes the most powerful messages don't need words
          at all.
