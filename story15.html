        <p>
          <span id="Long"> I </span>n the mangrove swamps near Calabar, where
          the Cross River meets the sea, lived a talented palm wine tapper named
          Etim. He was known not just for collecting the sweetest palm wine, but
          for the rhythms he would tap on the palm trees with his collection
          gourds. The trees seemed to dance to his beats, producing wine sweeter
          than any other in the land. What most people didn't know was that Etim
          had learned these special rhythms from the water spirits who lived in
          the Cross River. Each morning, as the mist rose from the river, he
          would hear their drums echoing across the water, speaking in patterns
          that told stories of the river's secrets. One season, when the rains
          were late and the palm trees were producing less wine, the villagers
          began to worry. The annual New Yam Festival was approaching - a time
          when palm wine was needed in abundance for ceremonies and
          celebrations. Etim knew he had to seek help from the water spirits.
          Following the old traditions, he placed an offering of white chalk,
          gin, and kola nuts at the river's edge during the full moon. As
          midnight approached, the water began to ripple, and from its depths
          emerged Mami Water, the great water spirit, with hair like flowing
          water and scales that shimmered like fish in the moonlight. "I know
          why you've come," she said. "But remember, our rhythms are not meant
          for profit, but for harmony with nature." She taught Etim a new set of
          drum patterns - one to call the morning dew, another to summon the
          evening breeze, and a third to thank the trees for their gifts. Using
          these sacred rhythms, Etim helped not only his trees but all the palm
          trees in the region produce wine again. However, he noticed that the
          wine flowed most abundantly when he played not for himself, but during
          community ceremonies when people came together in celebration. From
          then on, Etim became known as the Palm Wine Drummer, keeper of sacred
          rhythms. He taught others that before taking from the palm trees, one
          must first give - give respect, give thanks, and give back to the
          community.

        Moral: Success comes not from what we take from nature, but from how we
        maintain harmony with it and share its gifts with others. The richest
        harvest comes when we remember that we are part of a larger community
        that includes both the seen and unseen worlds.
