          <span id="Long"> O </span>nce, in a time when rain was unknown to
          Earth, all the water in the world was held by a great king in Heaven.
          The Earth was dry and dusty, and plants could only grow near rivers
          and streams. People had to travel long distances just to find water
          for their basic needs. In the village closest to Heaven lived a brave
          young woman named Amara, who was known for her beautiful singing
          voice. Every evening, she would sit outside her hut and sing melodies
          so beautiful that even the birds would stop to listen. Her songs
          carried stories of the Earth's thirst and the struggles of her people.
          One day, her songs reached the ears of the king's daughter in Heaven.
          Moved by Amara's beautiful voice and the sadness of her songs, the
          princess would secretly lean over the edge of Heaven to listen. During
          one such evening, her father's precious water jar slipped from
          Heaven's edge and shattered upon hitting Earth. The water from the jar
          spread across the sky, creating clouds for the first time. As the
          clouds grew heavy, they began to release water in small drops - the
          first rain Earth had ever seen. The plants drank thirstily, and the
          people danced in joy. The king of Heaven was initially angry, but when
          he saw how the rain transformed the Earth - making it green and
          fertile - he realized that his water was meant to be shared. From that
          day forward, he ordered the clouds to regularly visit Earth with their
          precious rain. Some say that even today, when you hear thunder, it's
          Amara, still singing her songs of gratitude. The rumbling is her voice
          echoing through the clouds
